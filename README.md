Go board
========

### Warning
This project was written for ELM 0.15. Needs to be ported to the current version of ELM.

# Info
Small project written in [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/)

It's a Go board, where you can place stones on turns. The board doesn't know how to play Go, so it wont remove dead stones (would be a nice thing to add).
