Go board
========

Small project written in [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/)

It's a Go board, where you can place stones on turns. The board doesn't know how to play Go, so it wont remove dead stones (would be a nice thing to add).

If you want a Demo, go to [elm-lang.org/try](http://elm-lang.org/try) and copy the code in [go.elm](https://github.com/marhs/elm-go/blob/master/go.elm)
